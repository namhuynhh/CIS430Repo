			Red is the color at the longer-wavelengths end of the spectrum of 
			visible light next to orange, at the opposite end from violet. Red 
			color has a predominant light wavelength of roughly 620–740 
			nanometers. Light with a longer wavelength than red but shorter 
			than terahertz radiation and microwave is called infrared.

		<p>
			Green is the color between blue and yellow on the spectrum of 
			visible light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength 
			of roughly 495–570 nm. In the subtractive color system, used in 
			painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of 
			yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used 
			on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive 
			primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in 
			different combinations to create all other colors.

		<p>
			Blue is the colour between violet and green on the optical spectrum 
			of visible light. Human eyes perceive blue when observing light 
			with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres, which is between 
			45 and 49.5 Ångströms. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a 
			shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a 
			lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more 
			green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometers 
			(47 Ångströms). In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is 
			one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and 
			yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours. Red and 
			blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form 
			green. Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used 
			to create all the colours on the screen of a television or 
			computer monitor.
