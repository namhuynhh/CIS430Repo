    <h3>Red</h3>
    <p>
      Red is the color at the longer-wavelengths end of the spectrum of 
      visible light next to orange, at the opposite end from violet. Red 
      color has a predominant light wavelength of roughly 620–740 
      nanometers. Light with a longer wavelength than red but shorter 
      than terahertz radiation and microwave is called infrared.

    <h3>Green</h3>
    <p>
      Green is the color between blue and yellow on the spectrum of 
      visible light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength 
      of roughly 495–570 nm. In the subtractive color system, used in 
      painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of 
      yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used 
      on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive 
      primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in 
      different combinations to create all other colors.

    <h3>Blue</h3>
    <p>
      Blue is the colour between violet and green on the optical spectrum 
      of visible light. Human eyes perceive blue when observing light 
      with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres, which is between 
      45 and 49.5 Ångströms. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a 
      shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a 
      lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more 
      green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometers 
      (47 Ångströms). In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is 
      one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and 
      yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours. Red and 
      blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form 
      green. Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used 
      to create all the colours on the screen of a television or 
      computer monitor.
